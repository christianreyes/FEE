							<p><h2>Managing Customer Expectations in Panama</h2></p>
							<p><strong>How do you manage customers’ expectations?  How do you respond to angry customers?  How do you use negotiations to get what you want and satisfy your customers?  How do expectations differ from one country to the next?</strong></p>
							<p>These, and many other important questions, were posed to a group of 20 Panamanian businesspeople who participated in an iCarnegie course in “Managing Customer Expectations” on April 8 and 9, 2011, at the Finisterre Suites in Panama City, Panama. Sponsored by INCAE Business School and taught by iCarnegie’s Chief Executive Officer Gil Taran, and Ed Barr, Chief Marketing Officer, the two-day session featured lectures as well as intense case study and role play as the participants resolved real world issues.</p>
							<p>INCAE is a leading provider of executive education in Latin America. Since 1964, participants from all over the world—representing over 20 nationalities and various types of companies and industries—have attended INCAE’s top-quality programs in management, marketing, operations, finance, human development, leadership, technology and several other disciplines.</p>
							<p>INCAE Business School has an applied approach that combines best practices and global frontier of knowledge with reality and the environment. This approach aligns well with iCarnegie’s learning-by-doing ideology; it is no surprise, then, that the two organizations have collaborated on numerous occasions.</p>
							<p>“We have worked with INCAE before,” said Taran.  “They have a world-renowned reputation and understand the needs of businesspeople in Latin America. This experience was no different. We had a challenging group of students, all of whom were obviously experienced and bright professionals. They were eager to learn, and became especially engaged in our negotiation role plays.  Their responses in this mock profesional setting impressed us; In demonstrating how they manage expectations, they challenged our own.”</p>

							<p><h2>iCarnegie Focuses on Lithuania's IT Industry</h2></p>
							<p><strong>iCarnegie CEO Gil Taran speaks to Vilnius' next generation of knowledge workers</strong></p>
							<p>On Friday, April 1, iCarnegie CEO Gil Taran traveled to Lithuania to meet with educators, government officials and business leaders. This marked the company’s first visit to the country, where iCarnegie aims to establish partnerships in a variety of sectors, providing programs in the areas of executive education, workforce development, and robotics for schoolchildren, among others.</p>
							<p>During the visit, Taran was invited to lecture on the art and science of managing technical people to information technology students at the nation’s oldest university, Vilnius University, which was established in 1571. He also spoke to members of INFOBALT, the Latvian Association of IT companies, about strategically aligning their IT market’s needs with education that would support their goals, and minimize their hiring challenges. He discussed the process of assisting government, businesses and the educational system in first defining an educational strategy, then developing and implementing an educational plan that aligns with their objectives.</p>
							<p>The city—and the aspirations of its people—left a lasting impression on Taran.</p>
							<p>“Visiting Vilnius was an exhilarating experience! It’s the hub of a country that is reconstructing itself, focusing on the enhancement of information communication technology as its primary competitive advantage,” he said.  “With the right strategy, Lithuania could become a major economic player in the Baltic region.”</p>
							<p>Taran also was excited about the instrumental role iCarnegie could play in the country’s future. “Through iCarnegie’s Global Learning Projects, we have already targeted similar challenges in other countries, and their successful outcomes suggest that we could create a lot of positive change here. A joint collaboration with Lithuania’s government and its business community would be invaluable to everyone involved—especially to its next generation of knowledge workers.”</p>

							<p><h2>iChallengeU 2011: THE RESULTS</h2></p>
							<p>In Astana, Kazakhstan, a crowd of several hundred students filled a large hall at Nazarbayev University eagerly awaiting the results of iChallengeU 2011, iCarnegie’s ultimate online puzzle.</p>
							<p>7pm on Friday, April 1 marked the beginning of a weekend, but those in attendance were held in suspense. Kristi Ries, Director of Marketing Communication, had traveled from iCarnegie’s headquarters in Pittsburgh to lead a presentation about NU’s School of Science and Technology—which the company will open in August 2011—and to announce the results of the competition.</p>
							<p>Designed by legendary German game developer David Münnich, iChallengeU 2011 tested the logic skills and scientific knowledge of nearly 200 college students on 37 teams. The puzzle began when the game launched on March 22.</p>
							<p>With 22 increasingly difficult levels, the stakes were very high. In order to ‘hack’ some levels, students had to print out pages, search through lengthy source code for clues or visually analyze a .wav file. Riddles ranged from science-related topics such as DNA translation to technology puzzles involving hints embedded in image files. The clock was ticking, and participation in the game kept on growing.</p>
							<p>Meanwhile, iCarnegie’s web-based RealTime Game Tracking allowed all teams – and viewers all over the globe – to witness teams’ progress live. iCarnegie credits this awesome online tool to the efforts of talented IT staff members Freddy Morgenstern and Amit Boob, led by CIO Michael Hemy.</p>
							<p>Before stating the winning teams, Ries teased the crowd, asking students if they REALLY wanted to know the results. The resounding “YES!” echoed off the walls. The hall buzzed with energy.</p>
							<p>Cheers accompanied the announcement of 3rd place I-TEAM, who gathered in front of the audience to be photographed and receive custom-designed certificates. Team members include Nursultan Yeltinov, Kuanysh Khabibullin, Iglik Alzhanov and Yerkanat Ramazanov. I-TEAM cited its members’ collective video game experience as a main factor in helping them to solve tough web-related riddles.</p>
							<p>Team 3NS secured the 2nd place spot in the competition. The audience roared as Abduokhapov Nauryzbek, Atymtayev Sultan, Bazhirov Nurzhan and Imanberdyiev Nursultan joined Ries for photos and 2nd place certificates.</p>
							<p>The winning team, Ad Astra, leveraged their individual talents to solve all 22 levels in just four days (and we’re not entirely convinced that they slept during this time). Team members laughed when reminded of an ‘unexpected’ answer in one of the later levels – a riddle that kept many teams out of the coveted 1st place spot.</p>
							<p>Team members Almaskhan Baimyshev, Sultan Duisenbay, Abylaikhan Tileukulov, Elshan Piriyev, Yerzhan Omarbekov all received 1st place certificates, custom-designed medals that read “iChallengeU Champion,” and sleek silver iPod Shuffles.</p>
							<p>All teams are featured on iCarnegie’s Facebook page here: http://on.fb.me/hJOlZB.</p>
							<p>iCarnegie congratulates all winners of iChallengeU 2011!</p>
